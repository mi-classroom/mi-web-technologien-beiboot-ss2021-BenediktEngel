# Server

## How to use

1. Install everything with `npm install`
2. Create an `.env`-file with `PORT:<YOUR_PORT>` on which the server should run. Also save the path to the data folder `FILE_DIRECTORY:<THE_PATH>` and an RegEx-pattern for the files `PATTERN:<YOUR_PATTERN>`.
3. Run `npm run start` for starting the server.
